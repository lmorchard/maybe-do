# Maybe Do

There are lots of TODO lists out there, but I keep a "Maybe Do" list of ideas
that I think I might do someday. 

The problem is, I have trouble figuring what to try doing first. So, I've long
wanted to try applying a bubble sort to that list with me as the comparator
function - a kind of "Hot or Not" for my own proposed action items.

This app is an attempt at trying out that idea, while also playing with a
smorgasboard of technologies including HTML, mobile, adaptive layouts, and open
web apps.
